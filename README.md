This is a platform for conversations

--------
## Recovery
  Typical use case: It's 2:00 am and my coach is fast asleep. What should I do about my neighbor, who acted like a real jerk?
  
  Features:
  1. Conversation management (create, reporting (summary data), privacy) (not complete)
  2. Long term memory (not complete)
  3. Multi-participant conversations (definitely not complete)
  4. Unprompted conversations (not complete)
  5. Fine-tuned to be helpful with the recovery process & support the human coach (not complete)

  Next:
     * Short term memory bug fix (can't remember name)
     * Long term memory + login
     * Save and load conversations
     * Save and load system prompts (also play with openAI `system` param in API)
     * Think about how to do fine-tuning
